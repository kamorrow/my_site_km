*Lepus americanus*, the snowshoe hare, is a species of hare found in the northern areas of North America. (Murray & Smith 2008)  It is known for its change in coloration from brown in the summer to white in the winter and its long, snowshoe-like, hind feet. (Montana 2018)  The population of snowshoe hares at Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in interior Alaska was monitored using capture-recapture methods from 1999 to 2012. (Kielland, Chapin, & Ruess 2017)

#### Analysis & Results
```{r}
# Read in data
bunnies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "showshoe_lter.csv")) # yes, yes rabbits != hares
```


```{r}
# Prepare data
adults_all <- bunnies %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% # dates to date class
  mutate(sex = str_to_upper(sex), # impose order on strings
         age = str_to_upper(age),
         month = month(date, label = TRUE), # create month variable
         year = year(date)) %>% # create year variable
  filter(sex %in% c("M", "F")) %>% # remove observations without definitive sex recorded
  drop_na(age, weight) %>% # remove observations without age or weight recorded
  filter(str_detect(age, pattern = "A")) %>% # filter for adults only
  mutate(age = "A") # wrangle age for consistency
```

         Male = M,
         Month = month) %>%

```
No observations were made between December and February in any year.  Variation in monthly observations is likely due to survey frequency and conditions on the ground rather than actual abundance.

         Male = M)

# Create data frame of mean weights by month for all adults
adults_summary_all <- adults_all %>%
