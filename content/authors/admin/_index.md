Keene Morrow is a graduate student in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  They are specializing in Energy & Climate and focusing in Environmental Data Science and Strategic Environmental Communication.

After college, Keene spent several years working as an environmental educator aboard traditionally rigged sailing vessels.  These tall ships took them to Washington, British Columbia, New Jersey, New York, Maine, and beyond.  When a respite from the nonstop nature of that work was needed, Keene headed back to Connecticut to work on the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection's parcel mapping project, the Connecticut Public Use and Benefit Land Registry. Keene contributed to PUBLR both at the department and later running an internship program based at Eastern Connecticut State University that allowed more than forty students to hone their GIS skills by contributing to the registry.  A twist of fate led Keene back to their first tall ship, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater to fill in as an education coordinator before they accepted the position of program logistics manager.
